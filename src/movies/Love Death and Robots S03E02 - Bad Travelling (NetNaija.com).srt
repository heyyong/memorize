as you must now with me.

The thing speaks.

99
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:05,458
You had a conversation with a crustacean?

100
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:09,291
Which I haven't the patience to explain
beyond saying that it wants passage

101
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:10,500
to the nearest island.

102
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:12,916

104
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:15,916
You'd have us believe
you will go up against it?

105
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,416
If, in fact, we do transport it
in the hopes it will spare our lives,

106
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,041
we have nothing substantial to feed it.

107
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:23,541

What about him then?
He's already half done, isn't he?

111
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:35,083
Yeah, he looks quite unwell.

112
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:37,500
He's half more alive
than anyone else will be

113
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,708

at my brother.

Phaiden Island.

135
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:34,333
This is where it wants to be taken.

136
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:38,541
With the wind at our backs,
it's still another day and a half.

137
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:40,625
And allowing this thanapod ashore

138
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:44,458
would mean unleashing it
on unsuspecting Phaiden citizenry.

139
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:45,375
Sounds good.

00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:46,333
[scoffing]

141
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,666
Just as soon spit on you as nod,

142
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,083
That happened to me.

143
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:53,750
Twice.

144
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:57,833
Nevertheless,
I propose another possibility.

145
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:01,250
These nameless islands
further on are deserted.

146
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:04,791
We may be able to take the monster there
without it even realizing.

147
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:10,500

at sparing countless innocent lives.

[ship creaking]

149
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,833
Fine, we shall put it to a vote.

150
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:19,708
Each of you will have equal voice.

151
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:24,541
It will be a secret ballot with no man
knowing any other man's choice.

152
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:28,083
You will privately mark
and fold your ballots,

153
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:29,750
then return them to me.

154
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:33,750
A circle will indicate a vote
to sail beyond the peopled shores

155

despite the risk.

156
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:39,416
And an X is a vote
for a shorter voyage to Phaiden Island.

157
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,750
X means you fulfill the creature's wish.

By a folded corner here,
an irregular edge there,

164
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:22,291
I made each of these ballots unique,
unbeknownst to anyone but myself.

165
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:26,541
Having paid strict attention
as I handed them out, the duty falls to me

166
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:31,791
to reveal I have succeeded
in ferreting out the cowards in our midst.

-W-what did he say?
-He said there are cowards.

00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:37,291
[thanopod clambering]

185
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:39,166
[thanopod screeching]

186
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,833
Double the meal,
double the time in between.

187
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:43,958
[squelching]

188
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:45,125
One would hope.

189
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:13,541
[ship creaking]

190
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:15,875
[suspenseful music playing]

191
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:22,083

[gun cocking]

193
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:29,083
[gasping]

194
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:32,916
[man] Wait, sir. Please!

195
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,958
[breath shuddering]

196
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:35,250
They made me.

197
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:36,333
[thanopod] Torrin.

198
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:39,125
-[thanopod clambering]
-[thanopod] Torrin!

199
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:43,958
Torrin!

200
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:46,333
[gun uncocking]

201
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:52,375
[squelching]

202
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:55,916
[chains rattling]

203
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:57,958
You rang?

204
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:02,375
Phaiden Island.

205
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:06,541
Phaiden Island.

206
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,083
Yes.

207
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:13,166
Patience is the word of the day.
We are well on our way--

208
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:15,791
[chittering]

209
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:16,916
[thanopod] Hungry.

210
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:21,291
Hungry.

211
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:22,958
[suspenseful music swelling]

212
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:24,458
Of course.

213
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:26,583
So many mouths to feed.

214
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:31,125
Must eat soon.

215
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:36,000
We must eat.

216
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:38,666
Hmm.

217
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,250
There lies Phaiden Island.

218
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:58,916
Closer by the minute.

219
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:07,416
I am willing to see
the failed attempt on my life

220
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,250
as an expression of low morale,

221
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:14,041
but this nightmare is very nearly
at an end.

222
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:15,083
I swear it.

223
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:17,833
And tomorrow, sir?
If your friend below us gets--

224
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:19,625
Maintain course!

225
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:22,541
And wake me at the toll of the hour.

226
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:27,791
[tense music playing]

227
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:46,666
[footsteps approaching]

228
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:54,583
[suspenseful music swelling]

229
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:03,208
[sizzling]

230
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:10,166
[sailors grunting, yelling]

231
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:13,083
[sailors panting]

232
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:15,625
Huh?

233
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:16,791
[floor creaking]

234
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:18,833
[gun cocking]

235
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:20,208
[intense music playing]

236
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:21,166
[grunting]

237
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:23,541
[gun cocking]

238
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:26,958
[man grunting]

239
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:28,583
[Torrin grunting]

240
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:30,625
[man 2 yelling, groaning]

241
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:36,958
[Torrin groaning, wincing]

242
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,083
[squelching]

243
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:56,708
[clattering]

244
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:05,916
[yelping]

245
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,791
I refused to participate.

246
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,375
And for that I am grateful.

247
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:26,000
[thanopod clambering]

248
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:27,333
[unnerving music playing]

249

[squelching]

250
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:37,083
[chittering]

251
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:41,291
[squelching]

252
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:43,875
[Torrin] <i>In the spirit of fairness,</i>

253
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:46,083
I lied before. [panting]

254
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:48,166
I didn't actually mark the ballots.

255
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,250
[thudding]

256
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:53,208
I didn't have to.

257
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:55,958
[man] Whoa, whoa.

258
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:58,083
Whoa! [yelling]

259
00:16:58,166 --> 00:17:01,666
Every one of you made an X.

260
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:02,833
[crunching]

261
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,125
[exhaling slowly]

262
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:20,208
[bird squawking]

263
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:30,791
[Torrin] We've arrived!

264
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:38,666
Show yourself.

265
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:49,166
Phaiden Island.

266
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,250
[Torrin] Yes.

267
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:54,375
As you know,

268
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:58,500
there's not much good eating
on a jable shark.

269
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:00,625
The meat

270
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:02,500
is greasy.

271
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,333
[gurgling]

272
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:07,166
[Torrin] And the hide

273
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:10,625
is too tough for any garment.

274
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:13,375
[gurgling]

275
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:17,625
But what they do have in abundance…

276
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:20,833
is oil.

277
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:25,291
Shell protects.

278
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:26,916
It's not for you.

279
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,750

[thanopod screeching]

288
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:27,583
[breathing heavily]

289

290
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
[straining]
