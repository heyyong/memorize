This is some bullshit, Sergeant.

00:00:44,416 --> 00:00:46,708
Shut the fuck up, Macy.

8
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:50,583
Folen! You're gonna get shot in the dick
if you stand in silhouette like that.

9
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:54,375
[spits] Yep. Right in the dick.

10
00:00:54,458 --> 00:00:57,083
I'm just trying
to see how far out I can get it.

13
00:01:02,708 --> 00:01:04,875
How much further to the objective, Sarge?

14
00:01:04,958 --> 00:01:07,458

Almost as big as my dick. [chuckles]

38

Muj didn't do this, Sergeant.

Who the hell's this guy?

00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:01,541
Sergeant First Class Morris,
attached to Task Force Griffin.

97
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:03,166
Stationed at Camp Eisenhower.

98
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,875
-It's right over that ridge.
-No such place as Camp Eisenhower.

99
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:08,166
Sure there is.
You just didn't know about it.

100
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,583
It's subterranean.

101
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,375
Bullshit that's where you're from.

102
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:13,250
You're stationed at Camp Bullshit,

103
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:16,250
and you drink
from a CamelBak full of lies.

104
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:21,458
CIA built it back in '02,
right after the invasion.

105
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:23,791
It's just another part
of our hearts and minds strategy.

106
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:26,791
And let me guess.
It's part of some Secret Squirrel op,

107
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:29,833
and you've got all kinds
of crazy sciencey shit under there,

108
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:33,000
including fucking nightmares
like that <i>thing.</i>

109
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:36,875
Well, that <i>thing</i>
is code named Project Barghest.

110
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:41,416
It was on patrol with us last night
when it started acting unpatriotic,

111
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,791
and treated my team
like an Afghani buffet.

112
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:48,666
Bar-guest? That's a stupid fucking name
for a honey badger.

113
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,708
It's not a honey badger.

114
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,625
It's a genetically-engineered grizzly bear

115
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:56,208
with a shit-ton
of mechanical augmentation.

116
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:58,416
-It's like a tank with fur.
-[electronic warbling]

diamond carbine canines,

119
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:08,000
all wrapped in a solid inch
of ballistic-resistant gel under its skin.

120
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:11,791
Small arms won't do jack-shit,
and even grenades won't hurt it.

121
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:13,875
Unless you get lucky, which you won't.

122
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:16,166
-Can you kill it with that?
-[Morris] This piece of shit?

123
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,916
No. It's supposed to be a remote control,

124
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,625
but the only thing that works is
this setting that says "fuck off."

125
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:25,083
Come on, guys. Let's go
to that base you don't think exists.

126
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:26,875
Well, Sarge?

127
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:30,416
Why not?
I doubt this shit could get any weirder.

128
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,250
[Morris] Dang it. It was right here.

129
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,291
It was right there. It was there.

130
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:37,291
There was a fucking rock. Fucking there.

131
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:41,708
It appears the secret back entrance
to your secret CIA base

132
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:44,708
is so extra fucking secret
even <i>you</i> can't find it.

133
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,208
Sarge, we got permission to die now?

134
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:49,125
Getting there, Folen. Getting there.

135
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:51,041
Oh, here it is. [chuckles]

Guessing it wasn't like this
when you left.

143
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:11,458
No. It fucking wasn't.

144
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:14,541
Well, personally,
I love what they've done with the place.

146
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:17,916
[Morris] All right.

147

Let's get some proper fucking ordnance

148
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:23,916
and kill the shit
out of this fucking thing!

149
