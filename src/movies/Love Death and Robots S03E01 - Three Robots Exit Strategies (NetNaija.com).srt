[robot 1] Yes. An in-depth survey
of post-apocalyptic humanity

to the collapse of civilization.

28
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:04,750
[robot 1] Humans thought that with freedom

from government-sponsored

00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:10,791

Well, I can definitely see

but where's the venison?

33
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:18,083
[robot 1] Humans hunted deer
to extinction,

34

along with every other animal
larger than a cat.

35
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:23,166
Yeah. Humans were snackish.

Oh!

37
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:27,541
[robot 1] Then they began
raiding each other's encampments.

38
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:31,208
They're not aiming out the windows
because the deer were coming for revenge.

[robot 2] You guys, you guys,

40
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:39,583
[robot 1] It's not a blood pit.
It's just a primitive booby trap.

41
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:40,833
Well, maybe now,

42
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:43,250
but these bodies
did have blood in them at one point

43
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:46,500
and their skin was pierced
by spikes, trickle, trickle, trickle,

44
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,666
times a bunch of bodies, hence blood pit.

49
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:01,541
only to become survivalist cult kebabs?

50
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:04,083
[robot 1] At least they died free
of governmental constraint.

On a <i>spike.</i>

52
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,208
On two spikes in that guy's case.

53
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:10,500
So, the whole of humanity

54
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:15,083
tried to make it through the end
of civilization with guns and spikes?

55
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:17,291
[chuckling] No, of course not.

56
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:18,583
Just the poor ones.

57
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:22,625
[robot 1] These humans had few economic
or social advantages and fewer options.

Yes, okay.

Technically true, but also,
it is a fully sovereign nation-state

67
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:56,708

During the collapse,
some wealthy humans attempted

71
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:07,750
to create a new civilization
in places like this.

72
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:09,875
Well, deer can't swim
across the ocean, can they?

73
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,375
So, what did they expect to eat?

74
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:14,416
[robot 1] Fish and sea greens,
but by then the seas had been overfished

75
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,500
and the food chain
was saturated with microplastics.

76
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:20,541
If they could've learned
to eat tiny exfoliating beads,

77
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:21,833
it would've been all right.

I'll stick with my fusion battery.
Thank you.

79
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:28,500
[robot 1] The seasteaders also made
one other large tactical error.

80
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:31,625
The people who built the seasteads
were mostly tech millionaires.

82
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:35,541
It's a lot like a regular millionaire,

83

but with a hoodie
and crippling social anxiety.

84
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:39,916
That wasn't helpful at all.

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,458
Just like a tech millionaire.

86

[robot 1] These humans
thought technology would save them,

87

with the practical skills

88

So if these tech millionaires had been
just a little more socially inclusive,

102
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:27,208
they might have survived?
