We got these fuckers now.

5
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:14,875
We're gonna lose comms in there. [sighs]

<i>The status of hostage?</i>

10
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:24,541
Still breathing.

11
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:26,916
We followed the insurgents
to a tunnel system.

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,041
[man] <i>Delta Zero Three, stand by.</i>

13
00:01:29,125 --> 00:01:32,000
It's getting kinda late.
Maybe we should back trail and break camp.

14
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:33,125
Wait till light.

15
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,750

25
00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:03,458
Spence,
I want IR markers at 25-meter intervals.

26

Soon as you stop fucking donkeys.

34
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:30,291
I told you, I was just petting it.
It was scared. What was I supposed to do?

35
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:32,625
All right.
Cut the bullshit. We're on the job.

36
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:37,875

What is it?

40
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:53,750
Some sort of lichen.

53
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:31,333
[Sarge] These must be the insurgents.
Didn't we just see these guys?

54
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:33,541
What kinda weapon
does that to a person, huh?

[whispering] Sarge,
the hostage was the mission.

61
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:52,708
We should take him home.

Okay. We gotta get the fuck out of here.

139
