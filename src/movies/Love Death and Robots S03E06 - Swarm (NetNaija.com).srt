00:00:57,458 --> 00:00:58,875

9
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:03,000
Our exchange of information
has been extremely valuable to me.

10
00:01:03,083 --> 00:01:05,541

But we do not understand
the profit you seek in studying the swarm.

14
00:01:12,791 --> 00:01:16,250
They are merely well-organized animals.

15
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:20,125

Well, we <i>humans</i> learn wherever we can.

Welcome.

27
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:24,750
Dr. Mirny. An honor to meet you.

28
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:27,166
And I you.

29
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,208
It's good to see another human face.

30
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:32,166
And please, call me Galina.

-[groans] What?
-Don't be alarmed.

33
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:38,291
It will convey your pheromones
to the queen.

34
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:43,041
Otherwise, you might be considered
an invader and killed.

35
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:49,125
I followed your study of the Swarm
with tremendous interest, Doctor.

36
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:52,250
But I had no idea you'd learned
to communicate with them.

37
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:54,041
Not exactly.

38
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:55,041
[squelching]

39
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:57,916
[Galina] I found
no Swarm castes that use language,

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,458
but several symbiote species still do.

41
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:03,708
I call these springtails.

42
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:06,125
I believe
they were once a spacefaring race

43
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:09,500
who discovered the Swarm
and were absorbed by it.

44
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,625
But now they are
little more than parasitic savages.

45
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:21,375
So far,
I've identified 15 unique symbiotic aliens

46
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:25,208
living among the hundreds
of specialized castes native to the Swarm.

47
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:34,916
Various strains of nutrient-rich fungi
are the hive's main food source.

48
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:38,958
Since our basic biochemistry is similar,
it's perfectly edible.

49
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:43,666

56
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:01,250
Makes it taste better too.

57
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,875
Mmm. It's wonderful. [gulps]

60
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:16,875
It can take us further into the Nest.

[ethereal music swelling]

[Galina] Heart of the Nest.

Whatever caste of worker is needed,

69
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:54,875
she can create it.

70
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:59,625
The entire Nest is a wonder
of genetic automation.

71
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:04,416
It is truly amazing.

72
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:07,125
[creature clatters]

00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,000

[creatures warbling]

76
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:17,541
[Galina] But only if you mean harm
to the queen and her eggs.

77
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:28,333
Dr. Afriel, I think it's time
you told me exactly why you're here.

78
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:31,166
As you've discovered,

79
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:34,000
the Swarm
is a near-perfect organic system.

80
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:39,875
With a resource like this, we can bring
order to the chaos of human expansion.

81
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:42,291
We must harness its power.

82
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:44,708
Exploit it, you mean.

83
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:48,458
If order is what you want,

84
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:50,916
look around.

85
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,958
It's always warm, it smells good,
and there's plenty of food.

86
00:05:55,458 --> 00:06:00,500
This Nest has been here
for millions of years.

87
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,916
Who will remember humanity
in even a thousand?

88
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:08,000
Even though I won't live
to see our race triumph,

89
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:10,541
it's enough that I can foresee that day.

90
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:13,083
Arrogance.

91
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:15,000
[tense music playing]

92
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:21,708
These creatures
are primordially innocent, Doctor.

93
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:25,500
They should never become pawns
in some power struggle light-years away.

94
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:29,958
[Afriel] But we only need
the genetic information from one egg.

95
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:32,125
With that, we can grow our <i>own</i> queen.

96
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:35,166
Her offspring will build a new nest.

97
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,416
They would be useless

98
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,000
without the Nest's pheromones
to control them.

99
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:41,125
Mm. Artificial vein.

100
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:43,333
This slipped past the Investor quarantine.

101
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:47,041
Inside is a selection
of the Swarm pheromones we synthesized

102
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:48,583
based on your samples.

103
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:52,416
If these work,
we could control millions of workers.

104
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,708
Armies of warriors.

105
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:57,000
-You are planning to breed a slave race.
-We could--

106
00:06:57,666 --> 00:07:00,541
You said yourself, they aren't sentient.

107
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:02,416
They're organic machines.

108
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:07,000
It's not as if they'd be staring up
at the stars pining for their freedom.

109
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:09,708
[inhales deeply]

110
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:10,875
It's true.

111
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:15,375
Whether they work for us or the Swarm
will make no difference to them.

112
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:19,250
And that is the beauty
of the idea, Doctor.

114
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:28,416

00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,791
My specialty is intelligence.

182
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:42,125
We… we mean you no harm.

183
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:44,416
We seek only knowledge and--

184
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,250
[Swarm] You sought to breed us.

185
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,208
Use us.

186
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:52,333
But your crude experiments

187
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:55,583
triggered certain genetic protocols,

188
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:58,333
and I was born.

189
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:02,666
I am only a few weeks old,

190
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:06,666
but I have millions of years
of racial memory.

191
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:10,125
You are clearly an intelligent being.

192
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:12,000
Surely we can find a way to--

193
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:14,583
Please, Doctor, I'm just a tool.

194
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:15,791
[breathes raggedly]

195
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:21,375
One the Swarm has used to deal
with threats like yours many times.

196
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:25,291
Through her memories,
I understand your race.

197
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:27,791
An especially vigorous one.

198
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:29,958
I expect they could be here,

199
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:33,333
competing with us
within a few hundred years.

200
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:36,083
Hmm. It will be sooner.

201
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:37,375
Perhaps.

202
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,333
But on the timescale the Swarm operates,

203
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:43,625
your race will soon be gone.

204
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,958
If… if you intend to destroy us, we will--

205
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:49,625
[yelling, choking]

206
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:52,625
Most likely, you'll destroy yourselves.

207
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:55,625
In… intelligence…

208
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:56,541
[inhales deeply]

209
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,791
…is not a winning survival trait.

210
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:00,875
[exhales, breathes heavily]

211
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:06,166
Consider the scavenger
feeding on your vomit.

212
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,666
Two million years ago,

213
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:12,583
its ancestors made the galaxy tremble.

214
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,458
When they attacked the Swarm,

215
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:20,125
we bred smarter, tougher versions
of their own race to fight them.

216
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:24,083
Our nests were the only world
they'd known,

217
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:27,208
and they fought with a fury
and inventiveness

218
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:29,375
we never could have matched.

219
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:32,625
It is an excellent strategy.

220
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:36,166
And the two of you
make a perfect breeding pair.

221
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:40,000
I would never betray my race.

222
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:41,250
I will kill myself.

223
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:47,083
In which case, I would simply clone you
and raise the children myself.

224
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:48,583
Bothersome.

225
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:52,291
And so I offer you a choice.

226
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:57,708
Remain an intelligent living being or…

227
00:13:57,791 --> 00:13:59,375
[gasps, moans]

228
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:00,375
[squelching]

229
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:02,708
[yelling, gasping]

230
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:05,375
…real ugly events…

231
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:07,458
[gasping, retching]

232
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:11,791
[sighs, chuckles]

233
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:14,208
So,

234
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:19,333
do you accept my offer, Doctor?

235
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:25,666
I accept your challenge.

236
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:28,875
We won't become parasites.

237
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:31,291
Humans are different.

238
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:34,541
Of course you are.

239
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,541
[squelching]

240
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:41,500
I'm glad I won't have to absorb you.

241
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:44,625
I would have missed

242
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,875
your conversation.

243
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:50,166
[music fades]

244
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,541
[electronic warbling]

245
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:03,375
[closing theme music playing]

246
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:03,458
[music fades]
